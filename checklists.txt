Before Milling
--------------
- machine power source different than stepper motor controller power source
- active Z-axis *unblocked*
- non-active Z-axis blocked
- no parts extending outside of north of milling table (to not hit the
  column)
- screen between workpiece and column (to minimize amount of chips falling
  between milling table and column)
- do fast movement on X-axis and Y-axis to detect any movement problems

After Milling
-------------
- machine power source off
- cnc driver power source off
